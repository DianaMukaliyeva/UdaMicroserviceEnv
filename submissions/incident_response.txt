1. Incident commander name:

Diana Mukaliyeva

2. Executive Summary of what happened:

Unauthorized access happened to the cluster. Three pods running three different crypto miners were launched.
Attackers are after compute resources to abuse for crypto-mining.

3. Summary of what was affected:

The CPU resources of the cluster were taken for crypto mining.

4. Summmry of the impact:

We had significant spike in the CPU utilization for Kubernetes cluster. This is related to the crypto miners being started.

5. Summary of the remediation steps:

- The crypto mining pods were deleted.
- Through monitoring the CPU utilization dashboard verified CPU utilization started to fall
- The Falco Dashboard Udacity Project also began to show decrease in amount of events

6. Summary of lessons learned:

- We had security bridge in our cluster. It's possible to use admission controllers to allow only certain images to be imported and started within the pods.
- Monitoring alerts from Falco in Grafana should alwasy be on. It is good that we have them.
