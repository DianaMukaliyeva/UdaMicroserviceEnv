* How will you test the changes?

We can test changes in test environment. Test environment means we should create another cluster with the same configuration as production.
In real world we can do canary testing by splitting some production traffic to the test environment with a load balancer configuration.
In our project it is not possible to test simulate directing traffic to test environment.
Without production traffic we can create load data by ourselves and make production like load to test environment.


* How will you ensure the changes don't negatively affect your cluster?

We should also monitor different metrics using observability and monitoring techniques with Prometheus and Grafana for example.
The monitoring should be done before we apply changes and after, so we can reflect if something goes wrong.

We should ensure that we are using version control like git to be able to rollback the changes.
